# NeuralNetwork
A .Net implementation of an artificial neural network

An example of evolving this neural network using a genetic algorithm can be found at [GeneticAlgorithm](https://github.com/jobeland/GeneticAlgorithm) and a full example using the neural network and genetic algorithm to evolve it's topology for a specific task can be found at [BasicGameNeuralNetworkTrainer](https://github.com/jobeland/BasicGameNeuralNetworkTrainer)
